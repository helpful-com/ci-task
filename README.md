CI Task
-------

This repo hosts the Docker image build for our CI Tasks dockerfile. The latest version should
be available from anywhere with `docker pull helpful/ci-task`.

If you want to build a new version, change the Dockerfile here and push your changes to master.
Dockerhub should build a new version of the image within a few minutes.

For details on the Docker Hub build system, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerrepos/
